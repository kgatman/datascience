# **Home**

I plan to document a lot of the areas I come across or interested in, in this data science field. I plan to learn delve much deeper in:

  - Data Modelling
  - Machine Learning
  - Star⭐ Schema for Data Analytics
  - Game Theory😭
  - etc...

I also plan to do:

### [**Dope R Visualizations Using ggplot2**](./viz/index.md)

    * coming soon⌛ <br>
    * I'm trying to figure out how I can make them interactive and not just plain png's or gifs🤔💭
